        <p class="py-6">There are four ways to donate: plasma, platelets, red cells, and whole blood. Those different components in our blood have many uses. During and after a donation, we are able to separate those components, to give a recipient exactly what they need.</p> 
        <p class="py-6">Keep in mind, the process can vary based on the type of donation. Eligibility varies too. We require certain qualifications to give plasma and platelets, compared to red cells and whole blood. Ask your phlebotomist what youâ€™re eligible to donate.</p>
